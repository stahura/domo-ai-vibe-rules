# manifest.json

The `manifest.json` file is critical - it declares all external resources your app needs. Domo uses this to:
1. Know which datasets, collections, workflows, and code engine functions to connect
2. Map aliases (used in your code) to actual Domo resource IDs (configured at publish time)

## Basic structure
```json
{
  "name": "My App Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "fullpage": true,
  "size": {
    "width": 4,
    "height": 3
  },
  "datasetsMapping": [],
  "collections": [],
  "workflowMapping": [],
  "packageMapping": []
}
```

## Key properties
- `name` / `version` - App metadata
- `id` - **Generated on first publish** (see deployment section)
- `fullpage` - Set `true` for full-page apps
- `size` - Card dimensions (width/height in grid units)
- `datasetsMapping` - Datasets the app can query
- `collections` - AppDB collections for storage
- `workflowMapping` - Workflows the app can trigger
- `packageMapping` - Code Engine functions the app can call

## Required files
- `manifest.json` - App configuration (required)
- `thumbnail.png` - App thumbnail image (required, must be alongside manifest.json)
